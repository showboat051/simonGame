# Simon, a colorful game that of which is the ultimate test of fun memory improvement!

# Here are the rules

* There are five(5) colored pieces on the board that will blink for one(1) second.  Only one piece will blink at a time but it is up to the player to match the pattern of flashes to keep the game going. Here the patterns will change with every successful round conducted by the player.  No two patterns will be the same for the player to match, making it a great memory challenge.
